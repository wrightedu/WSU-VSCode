# WSU-VSCode

A universal VSCode plugin for classes in the Wright State CSE department.

Note: This package does not install any compilers or debuggers, you should have those installed first by using [this guide](https://github.com/wrightedu/Programmers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/blob/master/Getting-Started/Software-Installations/README.md)


It turns out this the important README to keep updated is in `./wsu-vscode/` subdirectory.  

More to come here later...
